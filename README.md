# Text Manipulator Tool Kit

The project, named "Text Manipulator Tool Kit," is a Java-based application designed to analyze and manipulate text input provided by the user. This versatile toolkit offers various functionalities, including word and character counting, palindrome detection, string reversal, vowel and consonant analysis, and the calculation of average metrics. The user interacts with the program through a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Swing.
## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Compile and run the `ToolKit.java` file.
   - The application window will appear with a text field for entering a string of words, along with "Words", "Characters", "Palindrome", "Reversal", "Vowels", "Consonants" & "Average" buttons.

2. **Enter a string of words:**
   - Type a string of words into the provided text field.

6. **Find Reversal:**
   - Click the "Reversal" button to find the reverse version of the string of words.
     
7. **Count Number of Vowels:**
   - Click the "Number of Vowels" button to see the number of vowels in the entered string of words.

8. **Count Number of Consonants:**
   - Click the "Number of Consonants" button to see the number of consonants in the entered string of words.

9. **Average:**
